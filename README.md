# gravity-model-testing
### This repo is for testing the gravity model on data from http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele.asp

#### Notes:
* Github will not host the file `Gravity_V202211.csv`, because it is too big. You have to download it from the abovementioned website and then keep it on your laptop while *untracked* (otherwise you'll get an error and you won't be able to sync changes online)
* Don't open this file in the tabular form (in spreadsheets/editors), it might crash your laptop

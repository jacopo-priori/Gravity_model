Test of the Gravity Model, which predicts that trade flows between countries are positely related to their size and negatively related to their distance

Tested accordingly to this guide (https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/full-report-gravity-model-2013.pdf) and on this data (https://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele.asp) that is documented here (https://www.cepii.fr/DATA_DOWNLOAD/gravity/doc/Gravity_documentation.pdf)


#### Notes:
* Github will not host the file `Gravity_V202211.csv`, because it is too big. You have to download it from the abovementioned website and then keep it on your laptop while *untracked* (otherwise you'll get an error and you won't be able to sync changes online)
* Don't open this file in the tabular form (in spreadsheets/editors), it might crash your laptop
